## Backtesting and Trading Strategy Validation

In 2022, I deepened my studies in backtesting, a fundamental step to validate trading strategies before putting them into production. Tools like MetaTrader, Python, and online platforms facilitate this process.

### Recommendations:
- Always validate your strategy with historical data.
- Analyze metrics like drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and consistency.
- Don't rely only on past results: adapt and evolve your strategy.

Backtesting is the secret to trading with more confidence!
