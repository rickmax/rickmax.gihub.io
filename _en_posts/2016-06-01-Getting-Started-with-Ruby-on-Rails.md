## Where to start with Ruby on Rails?

If you're thinking about learning Ruby on Rails, congratulations! You're about to enter one of the most productive and friendly ecosystems in the web development world. But, like any beginning, doubts and difficulties may arise. This post is to help those who are starting and want to avoid the main obstacles.

### 1. What is Ruby on Rails?

Ruby on Rails (or simply Rails) is a framework for developing web applications written in Ruby. It follows the principle of "convention over configuration," which means you can be productive quickly, even without knowing all the framework details.

### 2. First Steps

- **Learn Ruby:** Before diving into Rails, it's essential to have a good foundation in Ruby. I recommend [Try Ruby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/) and the [official documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).
- **Watch quality classes:** There are excellent Ruby on Rails tutorials available online that explain clearly and didactically.

### 3. Essential Tools

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/)
- [Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)

> **Tip:** Never underestimate the power of official documentation. It's your best friend!

### 4. Development Environment

- **Avoid Windows:** My experience shows that Rails development on Windows can be frustrating due to bugs and incompatibilities. If possible, use Linux or macOS.
- **Linux is your ally:** If you can't invest in a Mac, Linux is an excellent option for Rails programming.
- **Docker:** Consider using Docker to create a consistent development environment across different platforms.
- **WSL:** Windows 10 brought WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which allows running a Linux terminal on Windows. It's an alternative, but may be slower.

### 5. Final Tips

- Always practice! The secret to learning Rails (and any technology) is to get your hands dirty.
- Participate in communities, forums, and study groups.
- Share your doubts and achievements.
