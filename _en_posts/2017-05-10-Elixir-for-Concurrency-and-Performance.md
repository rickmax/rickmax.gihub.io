## Elixir: Concurrency and Performance in Practice

In 2017, I started exploring Elixir, a functional language based on the Erlang virtual machine. Elixir stands out for its ability to handle thousands of simultaneous processes, making it ideal for applications that require high concurrency and performance.

### Why Elixir?
- **Scalability:** Ideal for distributed systems.
- **Resilience:** Fault tolerance inherited from Erlang.
- **Modern syntax:** Easy to learn for those who already know Ruby.

If you're looking for performance and want to learn a modern language, I recommend trying Elixir!
