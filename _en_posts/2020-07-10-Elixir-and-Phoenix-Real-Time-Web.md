## Elixir and Phoenix: Real-Time Web

In 2020, I deepened my studies in the Phoenix framework, which together with Elixir allows creating highly performant web applications with real-time features, such as chats and instant notifications.

### Strengths:
- **Channels:** Real-time communication easy to implement.
- **Scalability:** Ideal for systems that need to grow fast.
- **Productivity:** Modern tools and elegant syntax.

If you want to create modern web applications, Phoenix is worth knowing!
