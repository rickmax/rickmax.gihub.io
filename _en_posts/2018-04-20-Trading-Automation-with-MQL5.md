## Automating Trading Strategies with MQL5

In 2018, I deepened my studies in MQL5, the programming language for automation on the MetaTrader 5 platform. With it, you can create sophisticated trading robots (EAs), backtests, and custom indicators.

### Tips for beginners:
- Study practical examples in the official documentation.
- Always test on demo accounts before operating with real money.
- Participate in forums to exchange experiences and strategies.

Automating your trading can bring discipline and agility to your operations!
